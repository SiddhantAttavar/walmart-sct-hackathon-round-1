The algorithm we used for our submission is a combination of 2 well-known algorithms:
- If number of nodes in the graph was <= 20:
	- We used the dynamic programming solution for the travelling salesman problem
	- Time complexity: O(n^n * 2^n)
	- Space complexity: O(n * 2^n)
- Otherwise (for part 5):
	- We constructed a minimum spanning tree of the graph using Prim's algorithm
	  We approximated the ideal Hamiltonian circuit as the pre-order traversal of the MST with a loop back to the starting point
	- Time complexity: O(n^2 * log(n))
	- Space complexity: O(n^2)
